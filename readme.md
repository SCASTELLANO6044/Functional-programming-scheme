# Scheme Programming Examples

This repository contains Scheme code examples for various algorithms and functions. The programs are implemented in Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, and cover a range of commonly encountered problems.

## Algorithms and Functions

### Fibonacci Algorithm

The Fibonacci algorithm generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The code implementation can be found in [`fibonacci.scm`](fibonacci.scm).

### Exponent Calculation

The exponent calculation code calculates the exponent of a given number. The code implementation can be found in [`exponent.scm`](exponent.scm).

### Minimum Number in a List

The minimum number in a list code finds the minimum number in a given list of numbers. The code implementation can be found in [`minimum.scm`](minimum.scm).

### Inserting a Number in a Sorted Numeric List

The code to insert a number in a sorted numeric list inserts a number into a sorted list while maintaining the order. The code implementation can be found in [`insert.scm`](insert.scm).

### Concatenating Two Lists

The code to concatenate two lists combines two separate lists into a single list. The code implementation can be found in [`concatenate.scm`](concatenate.scm).

### Reversing a List

The code to reverse a list reverses the order of elements in a given list. The code implementation can be found in [`reverse.scm`](reverse.scm).

### Deleting Elements with a Given Parameter

The code to delete elements with a given parameter removes all occurrences of a specified parameter from a given list. The code implementation can be found in [`delete-param.scm`](delete-param.scm).

### Removing Duplicates from a List

The code to remove duplicates from a list eliminates all elements that appear more than once in the given list, resulting in a list with unique elements. The code implementation can be found in [`remove-duplicates.scm`](remove-duplicates.scm).

## Getting Started

To run the Scheme programs in this repository, you will need a Scheme interpreter installed on your system. One popular choice is Racket.

1. Install Racket from the official website: [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheme-programming-examples.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd scheme-programming-examples`
4. Run any of the Scheme files using the Racket interpreter: `racket --script filename.scm`

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your own learning and projects.
